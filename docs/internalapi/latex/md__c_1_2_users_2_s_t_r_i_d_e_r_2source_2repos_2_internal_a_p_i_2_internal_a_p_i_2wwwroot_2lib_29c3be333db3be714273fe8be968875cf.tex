For releases\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run {\ttfamily npm test}.
\item Run tests in {\ttfamily q-\/spec/run.\+html} in a representative sample of every browser under the sun.
\item Run {\ttfamily npm run cover} and make sure you\textquotesingle{}re happy with the results.
\item Run {\ttfamily npm run minify} and be sure to commit the resulting {\ttfamily q.\+min.\+js}.
\item Note the Gzipped size output by the previous command, and update {\ttfamily README.\+md} if it has changed to 1 significant digit.
\item Stash any local changes.
\item Update {\ttfamily CHANGES.\+md} to reflect all changes in the differences between {\ttfamily HEAD} and the previous tagged version. Give credit where credit is due.
\item Update {\ttfamily README.\+md} to address all new, non-\/experimental features.
\item Update the API reference on the Wiki to reflect all non-\/experimental features.
\item Use {\ttfamily npm version major\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}minor\texorpdfstring{$\vert$}{|}patch} to update {\ttfamily package.\+json}, commit, and tag the new version.
\item Use {\ttfamily npm publish} to send up a new release.
\item Send an email to the q-\/continuum mailing list announcing the new release and the notes from the change log. This helps folks maintaining other package ecosystems.
